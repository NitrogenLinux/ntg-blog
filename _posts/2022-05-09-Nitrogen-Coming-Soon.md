title: Nitrogen Linux coming soon
---

Hi there! As you may know, Nitrogen was originally supposed to launch in the first quarter of this year, but due to Nitrogen being rebased on Void Linux for stability purposes this was not possible.
The rebasing brought some issues, Elements had to had some stuff recoded but that was not complicated.
The problem is Chemical, which has been a pain to develop and adapt to Void because of multiple reasons.

Nitrogen Linux Zero-Nine should be out by July or June, and Nitrogen One, sometimes this year.
