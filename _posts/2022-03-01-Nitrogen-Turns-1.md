title: Nitrogen turns 1 year old
---

Hi Guys!
Today, Nitrogen Linux is 1 years old.

But a bit of history first...

In summer of 2020 a younger tekq started using Linux, and then in October of the same year, I created my first Linux distribution, named TekNix, which I forgot about and accidentally removed it, and then, a few weeks later I created Tekbuntu, which again did not get released.

Now onto 1 year ago...

In March of 2021, me and the other founder R3X, decided to create a Linux distribution, named TekOS.
TekOS originally had 2 versions, Stable, and Rolling.
Stable would've been based of Ubuntu LTS, and would've been maintained by R3X.
Rolling would've been based of Arch, and would've been maintained by me.
We had a finished website and a few wallpapers, also a non-working iso for the Stable version, but it all ended after about a month from creation due to a small fight between me and the other founder, R3X.

R3X's removal from TekOS...

At this point R3X has been completely removed from TekOS, along with my old GitHub account, and all the repositories.

Nitrogen appearance...

Soon after, Sulphur OS became a thing, but due to me not liking the name, I changed it quickly to Nitrogen Linux, and then to Nitrogen Project
From here, Nitrogen was kinda dead, barely any updates since til September
And then...

Nitrogen's revival...

On September 2nd I started coding Elements, and it released that same day, with a repository to go along with it
A few days later, I started Coding NitroFI, which is now an Archived and Broken installer for Nitrogen
Nitrogen officially launched version 0.1 Sulphur using NitroFI and the at the time newest version of Elements

The Elements Zero-Nine disaster

First of all, Nitrogen and Elements have changed name schemes, from lets say "0.9 Sulphur", it became "Zero-Nine"
Now onto the disaster that Zero-Nine was, Zero-Nine was a very big jump, a jump that added a lot of bugs and problems. Basically, Elements Zero-Nine was unusable
Thats why, for Elements One something had to be done

Elements One

Just before New Years, I started recoding Elements, which got into the -next repository, and when it was finished, it launched, and it thankfully worked as intended

Current Day Nitrogen...

Now that we covered the whole story of Nitrogen, from the TekOS day, right til now...
Nitrogen One's release is officially Q1 2022, so get ready for that.
Elements One works very good, and also thankfully works unlike Zero-Nine
Also one of the most important components of Nitrogen, the installer, is also launched, and works pretty nicely.

Nitrogen in the future...

Nitrogen will not go away any time soon, it is my biggest project, and the one I am most proud of. It might change, anything, in the future, but it will not go away.

Also, I would like to thank the Nitrogen Team, all of you guys are amazing, so thank you to: Skunxyy, R3X, Fear and Paty for this amazing year.
And also, thank you for reading this, I hope you enjoyed it!
