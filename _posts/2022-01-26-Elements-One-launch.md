Hey all tekq here!
I would like to announce that Elements One is finally out, probably one of the toughest version to create, ill get into later in this post.

First of all, thank to all of you Nitrogen Team, you're awesome. Now, Elements One has been a tough update due to a complete recode of Elements, Zero-Nine was incredibly glitchy, and borderline unusable, so instead of fixing it, which I have no idea how hard it would've been, I decided to recode it.

Now onto Nitrogen Zero-Nine and One, since Elements is now officially out, updates will go a bit slower, Ill most probably start working on Chemical and maybe more. Regarding Nitrogen Zero-Nine, it may come soon, and depends on how much I need to work for Nitrogen One, Nitrogen One may also be coming soon!
