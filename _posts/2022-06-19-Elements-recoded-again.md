title: Elements is being recoded in Rust
---

Hi! Not many updates for the past few weeks huh?
Well, I've actually been releasing a few Betas for Nitrogen Zero-Nine.
Other than that, I had exams.
Now that I am done with those exams, I am once again remaking Elements, this time in Rust instead of Python.

Hopefully Nitrogen Zero-Nine can release this summer.
